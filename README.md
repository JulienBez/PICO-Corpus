# PICO-Corpus
The corpus consists of about 1,011 PubMed abstracts which are RCTs related to breast cancer. For each abstract, text snippets that identify the Participants, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO elements) are annotated.
The abstracts were annotated using BRAT (https://brat.nlplab.org/).
We shared the brat annotated files.
